module UI
  # Component encapsulating the widgets for managing the status of services (both
  # currently and on system boot) and the behavior associated to those widgets
  #
  # As long as #handle_input is invoked in the event loop, the component will
  # handle interactive starting and stopping of the service on user demand. In
  # addition #reload_if_requested can be used after saving the settings.
  #
  # To manage the status on boot, the component can be queried for the user
  # selection using #enabled?. In addition enabled_callback (in constructor)
  # can be used to observe the status of the corresponding field in the UI.
